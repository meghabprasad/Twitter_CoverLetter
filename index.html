                    Before I decided to pursure Engineering, I was a pre-med student conducting research at Stanford University. Being exposed to both engineering and medicine allowed me see the impact that technology can make on individual lives, which bolstered my passion to enter the engineering field.
                    <br><br>
                    Prior to starting my training, I did a great deal of self-reflection trying to decide which career path to choose and what I wanted to make of myself. Having spent several years preparing to become a doctor, deciding to pivot to an entirely different career field was not easy for me. However, I told myself that the best case scenario of completing porgramming courses is that I will find a career that is both exciting and challenging for me and the worst case scenario is that I learn a new skill.
                    <br><br>
                    Upon completion of my courses and software research studies, I am excited to pursue a career in Software Engineering and build impactful products all while having fun!

                        My curiosity to learn about technology is what got me here. I am always looking to learn new skills and find creative ways to spend my time. Whether it's learning a new technology or how to surf, I am always excited to learn and improve!

                        In our day to day lives, we are constantly learning new things, exploring new opportunities, developing opinions, and evolving as humans. Twitter allows anyone to share this knowledge with the world and potentially help resolve issues that people across the globe are facing. This is awesome!
